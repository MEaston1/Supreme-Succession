# Supreme-Succession

note: this app is still a WIP

This app uses fragments and a roulette-style spinning wheel to show potential candidates for the successor to Kim Jong Un as the leader of the DPRK.
The spinning wheel includes 8 potential candidates from the Kim family or high ranking DPRK positions. When the wheel finishes on a candidate that 
candidate's information profile will be shown in a fragment along with a link to their Wiki page.

The app also includes a grid recyclerview which displays a list of all potential candidates and serves as an access point to view all of their detail
profiles.
